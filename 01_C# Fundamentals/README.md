### EXERCISE 
1. Write a C# Sharp program to check two given integers, and return true if one of them is 30 or if their sum is 30. 
2. Write a C# Sharp program to check if a given positive number is a multiple of 3.
3. Write a program in C# Sharp to display the first 10 natural numbers.
4. Write a program in C# Sharp to read 10 numbers from keyboard and find their sum and average.
5. Write a program in C# Sharp to display the cube of the number up to given an integer.
6. Write a program in C# Sharp to display the pattern like right angle triangle using an asterisk. 
                The pattern like :</BR>
                *</BR>
                **</BR>
                ***</BR>
                ****</BR>
7. Write a program in C# Sharp to display the pattern like right angle triangle with a number. 
                The pattern like :</BR>
                1</BR>
                12</BR>

                1234</BR>
8. Write a program in C# Sharp to make such a pattern like right angle triangle with a number which will repeat a number in a row. 
                The pattern like :</BR>
                1</BR>
                22</BR>
